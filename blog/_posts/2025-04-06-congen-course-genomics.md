During one week, at the lovely landscape of Mértola city, we taught at the PhD Advanced Course "Conservation Genetics: fundaments and applications", organized by my former coleagues Paulo Célio alves, Soraia Barbosa from the University of Porto. I joined a team of invited teachers, along Matthew P. Hare and Jeremy Searle from Cornell University.
