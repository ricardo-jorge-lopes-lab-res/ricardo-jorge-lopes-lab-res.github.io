It was a great day, visiting my alma mater institution, the Department of Life Sciences of the University of Coimbra. 

I was happy to be a part of the PhD Viva of Sara Mendes, that defended her PhD in Ecology thesis "Seed dispersal networks in the Antropocene". Congratulations also to the supervisors, Jen M. Olesen (Univ. de Aarhus, Dinamarca) and Ruben Heleno (University of Coimbra). It was also a great time to see again many of my dearest coleagues and friends in Coimbra.
