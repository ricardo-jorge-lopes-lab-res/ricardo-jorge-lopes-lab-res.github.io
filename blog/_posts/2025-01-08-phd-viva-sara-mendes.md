What an incredible day revisiting my alma mater, the Department of Life Sciences at the University of Coimbra!

I had the privilege of being part of Sara Mendes' PhD viva, where she brilliantly defended her thesis, "Seed Dispersal Networks in the Anthropocene." Huge congratulations to Sara and her supervisors, Jens M. Olesen (Aarhus University, Denmark) and especially Ruben Heleno (University of Coimbra), who kindly invited me.

It was also a joy to reconnect with dear colleagues and friends in Coimbra. Such a nostalgic and heartwarming experience!
