During the first half of March, every Saturday, the [Little Naturalists](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?vanity=mhnc.up.pt&set=a.1183060357155788) explored the world of birds at the Biodiversity Hall and Botanical Garden of the University of Porto. They delved into the fascinating universe of birds, observing and describing their diverse features: beaks, feet, wings, feathers, scales, and eggs in all colors, shapes, and sizes. They also studied bird anatomy, behavior, and their remarkable, sometimes surprising vocalizations. Through engaging games, they learned how to classify birds into groups based on shared characteristics. Alongside species observed in the U.Porto Botanical Garden, they explored preserved specimens from MHNC-UP’s collections.
