Carla is a PhD student on Veterinary Medicine from the University of Agricultural Sciences and Veterinary Medicine of Cluj-Napoca (Romania). While she is waiting for her PhD defense, she visited our lab and helped us optimizing our protocols for digitizing large images of avian blood smears.

These images will be used to test the machine learning approaches that are being developed under the WIMANET COST Action objectives.
