If there has been a constant in my research routines has been the annual International Waterbird Census (IWC) at the Mondego Estuary, that I have been coordinating for decades. I always feel revigorated after visiting the diverse habitats, from mudflats, saltpans, reedbeds to ricefields. All this to count the amazing diversity of waterbirds that use this hotspot during winter.

These counts are then incorporated at the Portuguese National Census of Wintering Aquatic Birds and at the IWC, run by Wetlands Internacional.

It is also a great to way to stay in touch with some of my fellow observers, Tiago MÃºrias and Luis Pascoal da Silva, both from the University of Porto (CIBIO-BIOPOLIS), that also share my passion for this estuary and these birds.

**The south arm mudflats harbour such a great diversity of shorebirds and other aquatic birds. It was fantastic to see so many ospreys in our line of sight!**
