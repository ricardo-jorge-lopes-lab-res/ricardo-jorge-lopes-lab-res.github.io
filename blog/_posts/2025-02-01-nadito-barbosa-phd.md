Nadito Barbosa won a PhD grant from the Portuguese National Science Agency (FCT) in 2024 and he just started his PhD at the BIODIV Doctoral Programme at FCUL. He will focus on enhancing the power of passive acoustic to monitor biodiversity in Cabo Verde, working  closely with the NGOs from each island and complementing the ongoing Bird Atlas of Cabo Verde.
