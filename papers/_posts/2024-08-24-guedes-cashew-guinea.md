# Abstract
Our commentary explores the increase in cashew cultivation across West Africa, drawing attention to its impacts on biodiversity and livelihoods. We summarize the issue regionally, then showcase Guinea-Bissau, where we unravel the dynamics between cashew expansion, habitat and biodiversity loss, and livelihoods. Finally, we propose concrete policy measures encompassing strengthened conservation, sustainable land-use planning, enhanced farming practices, community engagement, and international market reforms. Our recommendations extend beyond both a recent review (Rege et al. 2023) and a concise policy commentary on EU deforestation law (Powell et al. 2023) in offering a roadmap for sustainable cashew cultivation.
