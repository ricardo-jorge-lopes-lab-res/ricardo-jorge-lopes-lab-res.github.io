# Abstract

The Wildlife Malaria Network (WIMANET) is an EU-COST-funded global network of researchers and stakeholders interested in wildlife malaria and related haemosporidian parasites. The network has six working groups covering a diverse range of core topics within wildlife malaria research, focusing on genetics and genomics, species identification, vectors, haematology, communities, and communication. Up to now, the network includes 229 members from 45 countries including Europe, America, Africa, and Asia, but this number is continually growing. This review outlines the aims and goals of WIMANET, providing a summary of activities and plans for each of the six working groups for the next years. The network is open to new members, and we provide details on how both new and existing members can get involved in the network and take part in activities. WIMANET provides a global platform for collaborative and innovative research, and we encourage all members of the wildlife malaria community (and beyond) to take advantage of the opportunities the network offers.
