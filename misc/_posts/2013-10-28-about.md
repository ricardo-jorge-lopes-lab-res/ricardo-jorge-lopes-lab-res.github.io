## Purpose

This website designed as an open science showcase for recent work from the Ricardo Jorge Lopes Lab.  We have a [blog](/blog/) for news and smaller analyses, but also [project pages](/projects/) that mirror ongoing research developments.  This structure is meant to make sharing of results as frictionless as possible.

## Source code

All source code that's necessary to construct the site is [freely available on GitHub](https://github.com/ricardo-jorge-lopes-lab-res/ricardo-jorge-lopes-lab-res.github.io) and was mostly borrowed from the Bedford Lab [bedford.io](http://bedford.io).
